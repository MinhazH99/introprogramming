# Alternative, if we can read and write to a Python file:
# Assume a  exists
# Define volunteer dictionary
# Define dictionary of camps in existence
# Define dictionary of weekdays, month, day
# For availability, break down into day, shift ( three eight-hour shifts; input one at a time, sign up for no more than two in a day)
# Camp to work at
# Exceptions: input out of range, wrong input type, date that has passed, date more than a month in advance
# Define counter for number of shifts worked in a particular day/ week
# At each step, ask user if finished
# Display results of decision once finished
